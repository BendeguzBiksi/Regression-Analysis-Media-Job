# Regression-Analysis-Media-Job
As a data analyst at a Media Agency I was doing a regression analysis project for one of our clients. The main goal of the project was to find out the effect of media spending (a.k.a. advertising) on the sales volume of the client. I did the whole project from top to bottom on my own i.e. collecting the data, compounding the dataset into the proper format, exploring it, analysing and finally presenting my findings to the client. I used Excel and R. Attached please find the R code.
