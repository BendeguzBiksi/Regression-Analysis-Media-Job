# Regression-Analysis-Media-Job
As a Data Analyst at a Media Agency I was doing a regression analysis project for one of our clients. The main goal of the project was to find out the effect of media spending (a.k.a. advertising) on the sales volume of the client. I did the whole project from top to bottom on my own i.e. collecting the data, compounding the dataset into the proper format, exploring it, analysing and finally presenting my findings to the client. I used Excel and R. Attached please find the R code.

Details, explanations to the code:
The client is active on the margarine market. She does advertising in multiple platforms: TV, internet, magazines, radio. The client (in the dataset: abc corp) has multiple brands. Furthermore its product is also diveded into two subcategories, that is why I made two regressions, one for each subcategory. Moreover the client has competitors in the market, who also spend on advertising influencing the client's sales. Lastly, the effect of advertising is delayed in time, meaning that I have to adjust for that. In the Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) literature a technique, so called "adstocking" has become widespread. In a nutshell we multiple the last value of the adstocked media variable and sum it with the current media value. In the first period the adstocked media variable is equal to the original (non-adstocked) media variable. By doing so we are taking into account the time decaying effect of advertisement on sales.
